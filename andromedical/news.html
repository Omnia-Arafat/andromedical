            Featured article: Determination of cannabinoids in Cannabis sativa L. samples for recreational, medical, and forensic purposes</h1>
		
						<br><br><br><br>

            <p class="a">An increasing demand for cannabis-derived products for recreational 
                and medical use has led to the need for reliable 
                and fast quantification of cannabinoids in hemp samples.
                 In this paper from Zivovinovic et al., 
                 the authors report the successful development of an accurate 
                 and broadly applicable RP-HPLC method coupled to a UV detector 
                 including an optimized extraction procedure for the separation
				and quantification of eight different cannabinoids.<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/">Read More </a> </p>

				<br><br><br><br>
        <p class="b">The research is published in Nature Communications, a peer-reviewed, open access, scientific journal published by Nature Research.

            Instead of using chemicals or radiation, immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps the patient's immune system fight cancer. T cells are a type of white blood cell that are of key importance to the immune system. Cytotoxic T cells are like soldiers who search out and destroy the targeted invader cells.
               While there has been success in using immunotherapy for some types of cancer in the blood or blood-producing organs, a T cell's job is much more difficult in solid tumors. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210525113717.htm">Read More </a> </p>

        <h3 class="h3">How to boost muscle regeneration and rebuild tissue</h3>
						<br><br><br><br>

        <p class="c">In a study published on May 25, 2021, in Nature Communications, the investigators showed that using these compounds increased the regeneration of muscle cells in mice by activating the precursors of muscle cells, called myogenic progenitors. Although more work is needed before this approach can be applied in humans, the research provides insight into the underlying mechanisms related to muscle regeneration and growth and could one day help athletes as well as aging adults regenerate tissue more effectively.<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210525113717.htm">Read More </a> </p>

						<br><br><br><br>

        <p class="d">Today we present to you the best smart inventions ever, and this invention is a surprise for the blind and visually impaired, and it is a smart glasses that transform the written lines into an audible sound, follow the following lines with us to know this invention and how the blind and visually impaired can benefit from it.

            A Japanese company announced a very wonderful invention, as it revealed smart glasses through which texts can be read and converted into an audible voice Can you imagine how useful this invention will be to the blind? Thanks to this invention, the blind will be able to easily know the written texts instead of the effort expended in trying to read them .
            The Japanese company called these glasses "Oton Glass", as these glasses contain an earpiece and two cameras, both of which are linked to the frame of the glasses. As for the mechanism by which these glasses work, they are as follows: The first camera, its function, is that it tracks the personâ€™s eyes,  <a href="https://societyviral.com/a-stunning-invention-helps-the-blind-to-read/">Read More </a></p>

        <h5 class="h5">Lung Cancer</h5>
						<br><br><br><br>

        <p class="e">
            Cancer is a disease in which cells grow out of control and invade, erode, and destroy normal tissue. Damaged genes cause this development of cancer. These damaged genes are often a factor caused by such things such as the environment, and can be influenced by inherited factors. As the very early damaged cells divide they can evolve into a malignant cell population, and lose the control mechanism that govern normal cell division. These malignant cells can then go on to form solid tumours that start to destroy normal tissue. These can then spread to other parts of the body by releasing these tumour cells.
        
Tobacco smoke contains at least twenty carcinogens, which are known to cause lung cancer. Age can be a factor when asked what causes cancer. This is because cancer becomes more common as we get older. 85% of cancers are diagnosed in patients over fifty-five. This is because as we get older we become more susceptible to some types of carcinogens.
Age is also a cause as it takes a long time for a cell to become cancerous, as there has to be a number of changes to the genes within a cell before it turns into a cancerous cell. Therefore the longer we live; the more time there is for us to become susceptible to these mistakes in our genes. Our genetics are also another cause of cancer. If we are born with one of these genetic mutations, which can cause cancer, we are said to be genetically predispositioned.
